To view my code in action please access: https://tractian-front-end-challenge-mauve.vercel.app/

The application is fully responsive and was made to have the most features and most useful features in seven days based on the parameters of this challenge, anything that is not "perfect" its because of a combination of this and the [GEAR framework](https://gear.tractian.com/the-gear-framework-tractians-agile-engineering-culture-e0736c6c2384).

I am treating the data available from the APIs by the size they actually have, this is NOT an oversight, when the database grows and the application starts to loose performance we must update the APIs to recieve query params that represent filters that will help our application to fetch only what is needed.

Any information can be edited, but those changes do not persist because there are no POST/PATCH APIs, its just a mock.

Any question about any feature, component or why something was made the way it is, please dont hesitate to contact me.
